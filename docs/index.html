                <h2>The GREAT Founder Of Pakistan</h2>
                <p><b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah[a]</b> (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai;[b] 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948)
                    was a barrister, politician, and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the
                    All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947 and then as
                    Pakistan's first governor-general until his death a year later in 1948.

                    Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London,
                    England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in
                    national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the
                    Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his
                    political career, Jinnah advocated for Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact
                    between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent.
                    Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point
                    constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent.
                    In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
                    satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.</p>

                <p><b>Mohammed Ali Jinnah (1876–1948)</b> was a politician who founded Pakistan and served as its first
                    governor-general from 1947 to 1948. In Pakistan, he is known as the father of the nation.

                        <h3>Early Political Career
                        </h3>Jinnah started his political journey with the Indian National Congress in 1906. He wanted
                        India to have a higher status internationally and to create a sense of unity among all Indians.
                        At first, he focused on how Muslim interests fit into the bigger picture of Indian nationalism.

                        <h3>Shift to Muslim League
                        </h3>Over time, Muslims increasingly felt they needed to protect their own identity rather than
                        blend into a primarily Hindu Indian nation. The All-India Muslim League formed in 1906 to
                        safeguard Muslim interests. Jinnah joined the League in 1913, after being assured it was
                        dedicated to India's political freedom like the Congress Party.

                        <h3>Creation of Pakistan</h3>
                        By 1930, Jinnah became convinced that a separate Muslim homeland was the only way to protect
                        Muslim interests and their way of life in India. He feared Muslims would be excluded from
                        opportunities if power was held by the Hindu social structure. Jinnah led a campaign to unite
                        Muslims into a nation, and the Muslim League called for the creation of Pakistan in 1940.
                        Despite opposition, Jinnah's skill and determination led to the partition of India, and Pakistan
                        became an independent state in 1947.

                        <h3>First Governor-General</h3>
                        As the first head of Pakistan, Jinnah tackled the new country's challenges with authority. He
                        was highly respected and worked hard until his death in 1948. Jinnah's strong leadership was
                        crucial during Pakistan's early months. His death created a void that was difficult to fill, and
                        the country faced challenges regarding provincial power and representation.
